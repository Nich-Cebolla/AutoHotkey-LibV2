/**
 * @description - `ParseContinuationSection` is a parsing function for use with AHK code.
 * `ParseContinuationSection` will analyze the input text, and if the lines are joined by a
 * continuation operator or bracket, `ParseContinuationSection` will concatenate the related lines
 * into a single string.
 * - **Note** that, in this description and in the code, "Body" refers to the text content that follows
 * the operator, including the entire continuation section.
 * - **Limitations**:
 *   - If any quoted strings or comments contain one or more brackets that doesn't have an opposing
 * match, the string may need to be removed prior to calling `ParseContinuationSection`.
 *   - `ParseContinuationSection` is not designed to handle string continuation sections as described
 * here: {@link https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/Scripts.htm#continuation-section}. If you need
 * to handle string continuation sections, there's a pattern in
 * {@link https://github.com/Nich-Cebolla/AutoHotkey-LibV2/blob/main/re/Pattern.ahk}
 * that will match with valid string continuation sections.
 *
 * See test-files\test-ParseContinuationSection.ahk for a usage example.
 *
 * @param {VarRef} Text - The text to search. `Text` is expected to be AHK code. `Text` should contain
 * a statement with an operator that might be followed by a continuation section.
 * When `OutPosEnd` is calculated, it is relative to `Text`.
 * @param {Integer} Pos - The character position within `Text` where the left side of the statement
 * begins.
 * @param {String} Operator - The operator within the statement that might be followed by a
 * continuation section.
 * @param {VarRef} [OutPosEnd] - A variable that will receive the ending position of `OutBody`
 * relative to `Text`.
 * @param {VarRef} [OutBody] - A variable that will receive the portion of text that occurs after the
 * initial operator and ending at the end of the statement.
 * @param {VarRef} [OutLenBody] - A variable that will receive the length of `OutBody`.
 * @param {VarRef} [OutFullStatement] - A variable that will receive `OutBody` concatenated with
 * the left side of the statement (left of the operator).
 * @param {VarRef} [OutLenFullStatement] - A variable that will receive the length of `OutFullStatement`.
 *
 * @returns {String} - The complete statement.
