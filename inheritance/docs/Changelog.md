- Fixed an issue with `PropsInfoItem.Prototype.GetOwner`. Previously, it was possible for the method to return an incorrect value. While it is still possible for the method to return a value that is different from the original owner of the property, this is much less likely and less of a concern than previous. See the parameter hint above the method for details about the limitations of the method.
