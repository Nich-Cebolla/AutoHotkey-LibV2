# AutoHotkey-LibV2

Welcome to my collection of classes and functions written by me.

# Introduction

While I typically upload classes that have been tested and I know work, occasionally I make changes and don't always test the changes as thoroughly as I should. If something doesn't work as expected, if you submit an issue I will fix it. And for the bigger classes, I may not test every method before uploading.

Almost all classes and functions are fully documented in the file.

I often update files, and I do not keep a changelog nor report what changes were made other than the Github action description. With this in mind, this is how I recommend using this repo:

- Clone the repo
- When you decide you have a use for a file, copy the file into your lib folder (https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/Scripts.htm#lib). This enables the usage of `#include <FileName>` from any script.
- When you pull updates to the repo, check to see if an update breaks your script before updating your personal copy of the file.

For larger projects I typically will create an individual repo. Check out my other repos, and I would appreciate a star if any of my code helps you out! (Or even if it doesn't help you out).
